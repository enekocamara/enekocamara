# About Me:

My main languages are C/C++ and Rust.
I use C++ or rust for my main projects and use  vscode, visual studio 2022 community or neovim(if working with unix system).
For CLI applications(clap) and server-backend requests(warp, tokio, serde) I preffer Rust.
Python is mainly for running multiplatform scripts and for simple tasks like data visualization.

## Main Projects

### [Minecraft Mod]([https://github.com/enekocamara/Syris](https://github.com/enekocamara/minecraft_mod)) (Work in progress (ongoing))
Making my first minecraft mod. First time using java. Im using fabric for the API. Currently it aims to change minecraft world generation by prebaking a worldmap with all the data. Right now im working on tectonic plates and how they interact with one another.
### [Graphics Library](https://github.com/enekocamara/Syris) (Work in progress (paused))
A c++23 graphics library that abstracts opengl (vulkan in the future) to make simple graphics application faster. Its mainly for learning purposes and personal use only.
### [Build/Dependency manager](https://github.com/enekocamara/core) (Work in progress (paused))
A build/dependency manager for c++. Its a terminal application written in rust that generates CMakeLists files for building and manages
dependencies with github or curl. The project structure is described using yaml. All the dependencies are stored per project similar to node_modules. Im using it to build/manage Syris  and  new projects.
### [Pong Web Page](https://github.com/ualcibar/trancendence) (Finished mid 2024)
A web page that lets users play local/multiplayer pong games, lets them register/login with custom nickname and profile pictures, TFA, have friends/blocked_users, global and private chats, matchmaking history and a few other features.
The project consisted of angular for frontend, and for the backend we used docker with containers that run django, postgres and nginx. We did it between 4 people.

## Other older projects
[minishell](https://github.com/Llopeando/minishell42u) implemented only some of the commands, the rest using the ones already in the system.<br>
[IRC server](https://github.com/Llopeando/irc42u)
